# Project TODO List

- [ ] Fix bug `raise RuntimeError('Event loop is closed')` when running `just test-litestar`.
- [ ] Add proper best practices to both fastapi and litestar apps.
- [ ] Develop additional endpoints in both fastapi and litestar frameworks to
  diversify and expand the range of scenarios for a more comprehensive
  comparison between the two.
- [ ] Develop more complete unit tests (without using pytest) for the endpoints.
- [ ] Implement proper stress tests and generate comprehensive reports.
- [ ] Optional - Run stress tests locally and then deploy to a real platform, scaling up to a few instances for cost analysis.
